# House-Price-Prediction

🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project predicts house prices based on various features like area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location using supervised learning (regression) models like XGBoost Regressor. It demonstrates the end-to-end ML workflow from data preprocessing to model deployment.

🔍 Problem Statement
To develop a regression model that can predict the price of a house given its features. This is a classic machine learning problem that helps real-estate businesses and buyers to estimate house values.
